Welcome to my portfolio! Here you’ll find my robotics, design, and tech projects — from autonomous robots to web apps inspired by research.  

This first post is a test, but it also shows how posts will appear.  

Here’s a tiny sample of the work that’s coming:

{% highlight python %}
# Example: simple robot control
def move_forward(robot, steps):
    robot.forward(steps)
{% endhighlight %}

Stay tuned for full project write-ups and experiments!
